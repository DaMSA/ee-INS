TODO before 3.0 release
=======================


+ Application locks up. Identified scenarios:
	1. After running for a long time, clicking status icons.
	2. 
	
	Theory: AisHandler deadlock. Maybe because of new use from AisDialog.

+ AisDialog/AisHandler re-factoring
	* Expensive solution
	* Why call getShipList() from AisHandler.receive()? Removed call
	* Removed exception handling in AisHandler.publishUpdate(). Not proper way
	  to handle errors down the line.
	* Sleep 1 ms ?
	* static-access?
	 

+ Remove this file!
